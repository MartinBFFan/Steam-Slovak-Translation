corgiquest_d4b2 = MANY SCHOLARS AND ACADEMICS WILL INSIST FIRST-PERSON ACCOUNTS ARE FABRICATIONS, AND THAT SUCH A BARK CANNOT HAVE EVER OCCURRED. SEVEN'S DESCENDANTS WILL SUE FOR LIBEL SUCCESSFULLY, GET THIS, SIX TIMES. WILD, RIGHT. 
corgiquest_d4b3 = THE WARDS DISINTEGRATE AWAY INTO THE SPELL-WEAVE OR SOMETHING, AND THE TOWER IS OPEN.
corgiquest_d0 = YOU ENTER THE TOWER. IT'S AIRY AND WELL-LIT, BUT THAT JUST MAKES IT MORE OBVIOUS THAT THE FURNITURE IS LESS A HAND-PICKED FURNISHING AND MORE A COLLECTION OF NEEDED OBJECTS THAT SOMEONE CAME TO OWN AS THEY BECAME NECESSARY.
corgiquest_d01 = YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THEY KIND OF MATCH - THE EFFORT WAS MADE TO PICK SIMILAR DARKNESS WOODS, AND THE STYLES AREN'T COMPLETELY [br]DISSIMILAR. 
corgiquest_d02 = YOU CAN EASILY TELL FROM THE WEAR AND TEAR SOME HAVE BEEN IN USE LONGER, THOUGH, AND THE BRACKETS HOLDING THE LONGER SHELF ON THE WALL ARE BRASS, WHEREAS MOST OF THE OTHER METAL TRIMMING AND PIECES ARE IRON.
corgiquest_d03 = SEVEN HAS BEEN KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS BY A BUGBEAR WHILE YOU LOOKED AT THE FURNITURE. EXITS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, GIVEN THAT YOU'RE IN LIKE, A FIGHT.
corgiquest_d03l = YOU SPEND EVEN MORE TIME LOOKING AROUND, INADVISABLY, AND YOU ARE KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS BY A BUGBEAR. WOW. DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING. TRY AGAIN?
corgiquest_d03b = YOU BARK. IT'S NOT YOUR BEST. YOU'VE CERTAINLY DONE BETTER. TODAY, EVEN. THE BUGBEAR SWINGS A VERY HEAVY HAMMER AT YOU WITH HIS VERY LONG ARMS AND YOU ARE KNOCKED VERY UNCONSCIOUS. TRY AGAIN?
corgiquest_d03s = YOU WIELD(?) YOUR SWORD FOR DOGS IN THE MANNER TO WHICH YOU ARE [br]ACCUSTOMED, WHICH - ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW HOW DOGS USE SWORDS, RIGHT? I DON'T NEED TO DESCRIBE IT. YOU SLAY THE BUGBEAR.

corgiquest_d0d = YOU TRY TO GO DOWN THE STAIRS, AND IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE THEY GO UPWARDS.
corgiquest_d0u = YOU GO UP THE STAIRS, ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER. THERE IS AN ALTAR AND A MAGIC BOOK. EXITS ARE DOWN, IN VARYING SPEEDS DEPENDING ON IF YOU GO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION FIRST.
corgiquest_d0ul = YOU LOOK REALLY HARD AT THE LITERALLY TWO THINGS HERE. THE ALTAR LOOKS LIKE THE REGULAR KIND, NOT THE BAD CULT KIND. 
corgiquest_d0ul2 = THE BOOK FEELS PRETTY MAGICAL, BUT YOU CAN'T READ, SO EXACTLY IN WHAT WAY IT'S MAGICAL YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL. SURE WISH SEVEN WAS HERE. REAL TROOPER THAT SEVEN. RELIABLE.
corgiquest_d0ud = YOU FOCUS YOUR INNER SPIRIT AND TAKE IN THE MAGICAL ENERGIES OF THE BOOK AND THE ALTAR, BEFORE SPEAKING THE WORD OF POWER: POWER. YOU FEEL TANGIBLE REALITY SLIP AWAY.

computerearth2 = MANY ACADEMICS SUBSCRIBE TO THE THEORY THAT EARTH DOES NOT EXIST. THIS THEORY IS SUPPORTED BY THE FACT THAT IT'S REALLY IMPROBABLE, AND THAT'S JUST WHERE SCIENCE IS RIGHT NOW.
computerearth3 = GIVING FURTHER CREDENCE TO THIS THEORY IS, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, NOBODY CAN CLAIM TO HAVE EVER DISCOVERED EARTH. THERE IS ONLY RECORD OF PEOPLE 'SUPPOSEDLY' BEING BORN THERE, OR BEING TOLD THAT IT IS REAL.
