		// WEAPONS/EQUIPMENT
		"SFUI_Hint_Accurate_Range"		"A weapon's Accurate Range is the distance at which the weapon is guaranteed to hit a 30 cm dinner plate (from a standstill)."

		"SFUI_Hint_Flashbang_Careful"	"'Flashbang' grenades temporarily blind anyone who sees them go off.  Be careful because this includes your team and even yourself!"
		"SFUI_Hint_BuyArmor"			"Don't forget to buy armor in Competitive Mode! Wearing armor will increase the amount of damage you can take and allow you to live longer."
		"SFUI_Hint_Defusal_Speed"		"Don't forget your defuse kit in Competitive Mode!  Defuse kits significantly reduce the time it takes to defuse a planted bomb."
		"SFUI_Hint_Defuse_Wins"         "Defusing the bomb will always win the round regardless of how many enemies remain."
		"SFUI_Hint_AWP_Hint1"           "The AWP sniper rifle is very powerful and can usually kill with one shot. Take advantage of its powerful scope and engage from a distance."
		"SFUI_Hint_XM1014_Hint1"		"The XM1014 shotgun is extremely powerful and very useful in close quarters. At long range however, you're lucky to hit the broad side of a barn."
		"SFUI_Hint_M4A4_Hint1"          "The M4A4 carbine is a powerful and precise automatic rifle that excels at midrange combat, but can be mastered for both long range and CQB."
		"SFUI_Hint_AK47_Hint1"          "The AK-47 is as powerful as it is loud. It suffers from high recoil, but accurate marksmen prefer it for its lethal headshots."
		"SFUI_Hint_Deagle_Hint1"        "The Desert Eagle .50C is truly a 'hand cannon'. Its powerful ammunition stops enemies in their tracks, but its magazine holds few bullets."
		"SFUI_Hint_Backstab"			"If you're behind an enemy, stab them in the back with your knife. It does a lot more damage and usually results in an instant kill."
		"SFUI_Hint_Flashbang_Turn"		"Turning your view away from a Flashbang Grenade will lessen its blinding effects."
		"SFUI_Hint_Fire_Makes_Slow"		"Use molotovs and incendiary grenades to cover the ground with fire and slow enemy rushes."
		"SFUI_Hint_Smoke_At_Door"		"Smoke grenades are best used to hide your movement. Use them to pass open doorways or slip by a sniper."
		"SFUI_Hint_Grenades_On_Death"	"When you are killed, you will drop your most expensive weapon and most recently selected grenade for your teammates (or enemies)."
		"SFUI_Hint_Inspect_Weapon"		"Hold <font color='#FFFFFF'>[%+lookatweapon%]</font> to visually inspect your weapon."

		// MONEY

		"SFUI_Hint_ManageMoney1"		"In Classic modes, it's important to manage your money well. Buying the most expensive weapon you can afford is not always the best strategy."

		// BASIC GAMEPLAY
		"SFUI_Hint_Headhot1"			"In Competitive mode, if your opponent hasn't purchased a helmet, shooting them in the head with most weapons is an instant kill - a 'headshot'"
		"SFUI_Hint_Jump_Accuracy"		"Jumping slows your movement and decreases your accuracy."
		"SFUI_Hint_Stand_While_Sniping" "To be accurate with a sniper rifle, you must stand still when you fire your shot."
		"SFUI_Hint_KillingHostage"      "Harming hostages results in a severe cash penalty. Try to avoid injuring them."
		"SFUI_Hint_Reticule_Spread" "The outer aiming reticule indicates the spread of your weapon. The wider it is, the more inaccurate your shot will be."
		"SFUI_Hint_Crouch_Accuracy" "You are more accurate when you stand still. Crouching makes you the most accurate."
		"SFUI_Hint_Walk_Accuracy" "Enemies can hear your footsteps when you run. Walking will make your footsteps harder to hear and will improve your accuracy."
		"SFUI_Hint_Burst_Fire" "Firing an automatic weapon in short bursts will help you maintain control over your shots and will improve your accuracy."
		"SFUI_Hint_Switch_To_Pistol"	"Switching to your pistol is faster than reloading. In a firefight, this can give you the advantage."
		"SFUI_Hint_UpgradePostRound"	"If you're alive when the round ends in a Classic mode match, use those last few seconds to search for a better weapon!"

		// TIPS
		"SFUI_Hint_Stick_With_Team"		"Engaging in combat alone is very risky. Stick with your teammates and watch their back."

		"SFUI_Hint_Vulnerable_Reloading" "You are vulnerable when you are reloading. Make sure you are in a safe spot or behind cover when you reload."
		"SFUI_Hint_Shoot_Thru_Walls"	"Powerful guns can penetrate many thin surfaces. If your enemy is hiding behind a wooden door or plaster wall, you can probably still hit them."
		"SFUI_Hint_LearnRadar"			"Your radar shows teammates, enemies and the bomb. Learning to use the radar and checking it regularly will give you an advantage."
		"SFUI_Hint_WeaponSlowdown"		"The weapon you are holding affects your movement speed. Bulkier and heavier weapons cause you to run slower. Switch to your knife to move quickly."
		"SFUI_Hint_BeQuicker"			"Be quicker than your opponent in all aspects. One way to gain an advantage in Classic Mode is to buy your items quickly at round start."
		"SFUI_Hint_AvoidWater"			"Deep water will slow your movement and more importantly will make a lot of noise. Avoid wading through water if you can."
		"SFUI_Hint_PickupGuns"			"In Classic modes, players will drop their weapon when they die. If you see a weapon on the ground that is better than yours, you should pick it up."
		"SFUI_Hint_ControlBotDontKeep"	"When you're controlling a bot, money, kills, deaths and weapons that you earn are awarded to that bot instead of you."
