		"CSGO_Item_Desc_P250"												"A low-recoil firearm with a high rate of fire, the P250 is a relatively inexpensive choice against armored opponents."
		"CSGO_Item_Desc_CZ75a"												"A fully automatic variant of the CZ75, the CZ75-Auto is the ideal short-term choice for turning the tables and gaining your opponents weapon. But with very little ammo in the magazine, strong trigger discipline is required."
