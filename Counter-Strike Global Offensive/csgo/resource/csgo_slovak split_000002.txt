// Mission Objectives

	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_501"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Hello, my name is Sebastien Hennequet, and I'll be your CO for Operation Bloodhound.  Our purpose? Track down one of the most dangerous operators working for The Phoenix.  Under my training you will become more than a soldier... you'll become a hunter.   But before we begin our work with a rifle, you have to learn how to live long enough to get one. Become an expert with your sidearm, it's the fastest way to get the resources you'll need."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_502"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Until he betrayed us all, Chase Turner was a decorated member of the Coalition Taskforce.  It's suicide to engage him one on one, but with the right coordination we can kill him before he knows he's in your crosshairs.  The AWP is reliable and deadly, and the first tool of the trade you need to master."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_503"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Despite what Lt. Sabri may think, our victory depends on teamwork, not individual performance.  You're not alone out there: so even if you can't get a kill shot, sometimes wounding the enemy can be enough to tip the scales.  Use the SSG08 to support your allies."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_504"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Since aligning himself with Valeria, Turner does whatever he can to keep us off balance... forcing us to panic and lose focus.  But precision is the hallmark of a great operator... it's easy to wield an Aug like a cudgel, but can you use it as a scalpel?"
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_505"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We've launched 5 unsuccessful attempts on Turners life... he evaded us twice by using bad intel to trap us: if that happens to you, you need to be prepared for anything."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_510"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The success or failure of our missions hinge on brief moments: looking around the right corner... pulling the trigger at the right time...  I'm giving you three shots to kill your target... you should need only one."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_511"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: It's graduation day.  We've identified the location of Sergei, one of Valeria's low ranking lieutenants.  Find him.  Kill him...and prove to me that you're ready to hunt Turner."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_512"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We received word that Turner's terrorist cell has mobilized, this our last chance for weapons training before we go on the hunt."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_513"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: This doesn't make any sense... The Phoenix are raiding Season, but that target doesn't fit in Turner's MO... the target's not political, and the battlefield is too claustrophobic. Be careful when you're leaving bombsite A... there a ladder that leads you to a perfect sniping roost: Turner might be waiting for you."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_514"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner's greatest blow against us came when he assassinated Lord William, one of the Coalition Taskforce's biggest political and financial supporters.   By holding control of a tower he was able to pick off every operator we sent to Rescue Lord William... we can never let history repeat itself."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_515"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We noticed Phoenix activity at an abandoned rail yard... be careful as you secure the area: It may look like you're surrounded by cover but there are plenty of places that overlook the yard, particularly at bombsite B."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_516"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We tracked Turner's men to a shopping district the Maghreb region: tread softly when moving down side alleys to bombsite B.  There's a house with excellent visibility where Turner's men can plan an ambush. "
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_517"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner knows we're getting close: he's making a move on various soft targets all around the globe... he wants to use these hostage scenarios to divide the Coalition's resources and pick us off one at a time."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_526"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: This is the moment we've been waiting for:  We've confirmed that Turner is spearheading this hostage situation. Find him and kill him."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_506"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The man we hunt is Chase Turner.  He was a friend to many of us, and a protégé of mine... the most gifted sniper I ever trained.  Valeria's words have twisted him beyond recognition, and when the time comes it will fall on us to put him down.  Let's begin your training with the SSG08."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_507"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: There's a reason why the AWP is the bread and butter for many a marksman.  I've seen firsthand how one pull of the trigger can change the world... perfect your aim, and you might do the same one day."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_508"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Let's see if you have the discipline to learn what Lt. Sabri couldn't.  Not all precision instruments come with a scope. In the right hands, a Desert Eagle is still effective at long range and is a fraction of the cost of an AWP.  And as you know... early success can shape the rest of the battle."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_509"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We can't always control the terms of a skirmish, and the unfortunate reality of war is that rifles aren't cheap.  If Turner comes for you, you might not have your preferred rifle, and if that happens you have to be prepared to use whatever is on hand."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_518"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Before Turner became a traitor he was a world class operator.  With his instincts and ability to control sightlines he was once able to single handedly stop a terrorist plot to destroy the bay area zoo.  The way he told the story, he said he was able to kill The Phoenix and enjoy a dolphin show at the same time."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_519"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The seeds of Turner's betrayal began after a routine operation in the Maghreb region.  Valeria's agents were looking to bomb a shopping district, and we moved to stop them.  He must have killed a dozen men from the palace interior, but after the skirmish he came home changed... Valeria had reached out to him: and he was swayed by her silver tongue."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_520"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner's forces are bearing down on you.  Remember your training and use the AWP to control the bombsite. It's just the two of you out there, so be smart and cover each other's backs. "
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_521"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Valeria sent Turner on a mission to prove his devotion to the cause - the hijacking and transport of weapons grade plutonium.  One of his favorite tactics was taking control of offices overlooking the train yard, converting them to effective sniper's nests."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_522"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: His place in The Phoenix secured, Turner spearheaded an assault on one of Lord William's estates... the battle was long and brutal.   Turner raced to hold control of a tower on the property, holding off our forces while his new allies sought to complete their mission.  In the end we failed: Lord William was dead."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_523"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We sought Turner out more aggressively, but it didn't matter: he didn't just have knowledge of our tactics... he knew how to exploit every operator leading the Taskforce.  He launched a plot to kill Kotaro Izaki... using his hatred of Elliott Kingsman to lure him to the Season Corporation."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_524"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The death of Lord William sent ripples across Europe.  Soon Anarchists spouting the propaganda of The Phoenix took to the streets.  The only reason we held them off was because we were able to maintain the upper park."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_525"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Our last encounter with Turner was our most chilling.  He was using the rafters at bombsite B to pick us off one by one.  We drove them off... but not before they were able to destroy information regarding their cell: all we know for sure is that The Phoenix are preparing to hit a new civilian target."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_526"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: This is the moment we've been waiting for:  We've confirmed that Turner is among the operators at this hostage situation. If you see him in the engagement, don't hesitate to take him out."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_521_new"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner's cell is licking its wounds, but we can't afford to be complacent.  It's time for another weapons training exercise... when Turner peeks his head out, we'll be ready to take it off."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_526_new"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner's men are spreading across the Maghreb, looking to destroy villages that are unsympathetic to The Phoenix's cause.  In order to protect these people, we need to split up.  Take another operator and guard the bombsite.  Remember, this isn't a standard mission: do not. Leave. The bombsite."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_527"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: In the field we always have to reassess our surroundings and improvise.  This exercise is about not relying on Coalition resources... take out the enemy, then use their own weapons against them."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_528"						"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: I received word that your transport chopper was shot down over the Maghreb.  Evac is coming, but it's going to take time.  The two of you can survive this, just stick together and remember what I've taught you."
	"Op_Bloodhound_booth_529"						"<b>Booth</b>: So you're the operator everyone's all in a fuss about.  I'm sure helping out Mr. Hennequet on his vengeance quest is fun, but if you're interested in being more than an old man's catspaw, we should talk.  The name's Booth... and I'm always looking for talented individuals to make money with."
	"Op_Bloodhound_booth_530"						"<b>Booth</b>: What do you say we do a little Zen exercise?  While you're on the field, hunt some chickens for me.  Naturally I'm sure you're wondering why I'd ask for something so ludicrous.  Maybe I'm looking for you to test my wares... perhaps I'm judging how well you follow instructions... or maybe I just really hate chickens.  Either way, do what I ask and you will be rewarded."
	"Op_Bloodhound_booth_531"						"<b>Booth</b>: As much as I like to believe that people respect my business practices, the reality is that I sell guns to people who like to use them.... And eventually they might want to use them on me.  Show me that you can take whatever the world throws at you, and let the bodies of your enemies tell the story of your victory.   Do this... and I will happily put you on retainer."
	"Op_Bloodhound_booth_531_turner"					"<b>Booth</b>: Chase Turner was a man of conviction and talent... it's a shame that you killed him.  But there's no point in dwelling on the past, we need to move forward.  Killing Turner puts you into a very special tier of operators... and I have a special task for someone with your skillset."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_502_Turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Until he betrayed us all, Chase Turner was a decorated member of the Coalition Taskforce.  Seeing as you're the one who put him down... it's only fitting you carry on his legacy with the AWP."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_504_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: There's someone I'd like to meet, a defector from the Coalition Taskforce named Chase Turner.  But before you do, I have a final test for you.  Stand with your new brothers and sisters against your old ones... don't let our hostages be taken from us."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_505_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: With Turner dead, you can bet Valeria will be looking for vengeance... being able to adapt will be key to your survival."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_512_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner may be dead, but his cell is still out there.   We must stay vigilant and keep our skills sharp."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_513_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The Phoenix are raiding the Season Corporation, we need to deploy now!"
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_516_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: An anonymous tip reported Phoenix activity in a small town in the Maghreb.  Something about this doesn't feel right... be careful when moving down the side alleys... there may be an ambush."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_517_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: The Phoenix are making a move on various soft targets all around the globe... get out there and save those hostages!"
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_506_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Chase Turner was a friend to many of us, and a protégé of mine... I take no joy in his death, but he had to be put down.  Ah, we mustn't dwell in the past... but look towards the future."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_509_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We can't always control the terms of a skirmish, and the unfortunate reality of war is that rifles aren't cheap.  If Valeria comes for you, you might not have your preferred rifle, and if that happens you have to be prepared to use whatever is on hand."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_520_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Phoenix forces are bearing down on you.  Remember your training and use the AWP to control the bombsite.  It's just the two of you out there, so be smart and cover each other's backs."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_521_new_turner"				"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: Turner's cell is licking it's wounds, but we can't afford to be complacent.  It's time for another weapons training exercise..."
	"Op_bloodhound_Sebastien_525_turner"					"<b>Sebastien Hennequet</b>: We once encountered Turner in a compound like this one... He was using the rafters at bombsite B to pick us off one by one.  We drove them off... but not before they were able to destroy information regarding their cell: all we know for sure is that the Phoenix are preparing to hit a new civilian target."



	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_Two_Sides_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Evil.  Criminal.  Terrorist.  The reality is that I am none of these things.   My name is Valeria Jenner, and I am the voice of The Phoenix... and The Phoenix... is the voice of freedom.  It's said that you have talents that can be of use to The Struggle.   It's time for you to prove you have the skills you claim to have.  "
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_spark_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: You're not the first person whose eyes were opened to the hypocrisy that surrounds us.  To understand that for freedom to truly reign,  we must burn down governments.  Burn down religion.  Burn down the bourgeoisie... and only from those ashes can mankind rise pure and clean.  It's your turn to follow the path of The Phoenix... it's your turn to light the spark of revolution."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_Flames_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Fire is the weapon of the revolution.   Like us, fire breathes.  Like us, fire spreads.  Yes it takes lives, but without fire we would sit in darkness and die in the cold.  Do not be afraid of fire... master it."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_tyrants_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: We fight to unseat tyrants with resources superior to our own.  That's why we need to leverage surprise; striking fast and hard.   Lie in wait with your shotgun... then act decisively."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_booth_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Like it or not, the Arms Dealer named Booth plays a pivotal role in The Struggle.  Yes, he plays both sides but without his wares we wouldn't be able to topple tyrants.  Work with him.  Use him.  But never trust him."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_meet_mentor_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: There's someone I'd like you to meet, a defector from the Coalition Taskforce named Chase Turner.  But before you do, I have a final test for you.  Stand with your new brothers and sisters against your old ones... don't let our hostages be taken from us."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_booth"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Like it or not, the Arms Dealer named Booth plays a pivotal role in The Struggle.  Yes, he plays both sides but without his wares we wouldn't be able to topple tyrants.  Work with him.  Use him.  But never trust him."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_meet_mentor"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: There's someone I'd like to meet, a defector from the Coalition Taskforce named Chase Turner.  But before you do, I have a final test for you.  Stand with your new brothers and sisters against your old ones... don't let our hostages be taken from us."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_labels_turner"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: The media loves to label everything.  Civilian Casualties... Military Casualties... when the reality is that a life is a life.  Everyone on this Earth plays a role in The Struggle... and we all are culpable for our actions.  The men and women we capture are not random people, caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.  They are targeted for a reason... and we must never let them be taken from us."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_dead_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Turner is dead.  Struck down by a father who couldn't bear to see his son outshine him.  A reckoning will be coming for Mr. Hennequet... but for now I want him to hurt like we do.  I've located one of his star pupils, an operator named Jackson.  Find him.  Kill him.  And bring justice for The Phoenix."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_loyalty_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Your loyalty has been proven... and now The Phoenix has special need of you.   A nuclear facility we aim to take over has recently remodeled its toxic room.  I'm sending you and a fellow brother to secure the engineers responsible for the re-design.  We need to know what changes are coming."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_resources_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: We never know what resources we'll have available in the field, so it's important to be able to fight with a variety of weapons... not just the ones you're familiar with."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_conflict_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Some conflicts feel never ending.  The same dance that continues over and over.  Lesser men look to this and see futility, but The Phoenix sees hope.  As long as people are willing to die for what they believe is right, the cause is not lost.  We are not defined by our failures until the moment we refuse to stand back up."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_role_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Turner played an important role in The Struggle, and it now falls on you to walk in his footsteps.  Master the AWP... carry on a great man's legacy."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_message_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: The world is not yet ready for our message, but that doesn't mean our message does not need to be spread.  In time, fear will give way to understanding, and The Phoenix will be regarded as the heroes we are."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_pollock_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Comparing Javier and Turner's technique is like comparing  Pollock and  Kandinsky ... both are masters, but one is significantly more messy.  Not every assassination calls for a bloodbath.  When I call on you, I expect your kills to be clean and precise."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_blunt_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Marcus Chapel is Sebastien Hennequet's best friend.  Loyal. Courageous.  And an expert marksman.  He's also insanely predictable which is why I was able to lure him here. Stalk him and end his life... so that Hennequet will live out the rest of his in sorrow and misery."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_smg_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: The Phoenix has no need of cowards.  Often our victories hinge on relentless aggression... that's where SMGs come in.   Light enough to move swiftly, but a fast enough rate of fire to keep our enemies pinned down."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_knife_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: If you want to fight for change, there's  something I need you to do.  Kill a man with a knife.  Feel his blood on your hands,  Do not ignore it,  Do not sugar coat it,  Accept it.  For The Phoenix does not lie... not to the sleeping world... nor to ourselves."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_open_house_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Booth is hosting another one of his open houses... go and try out his wares... there may be a weapon you've overlooked that could suit you."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_rebirth_sub"						"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: The Phoenix is the symbol of rebirth... every skirmish we engage in, whether it is our fifth or our fiftieth is a new beginning.  Seize that opportunity and strike our oppressors down... then break their morale by turning their own weapons against them."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_underhill_turner_sub"				"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: People want to believe that change comes from within the system, but you and I both know better.  The system protects corporate stooges like Underhill and Murphy as they line their pockets promoting industries that cripple the common man.  Today their ivory tower begins to fall."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_maghreb_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Felix launched a campaign against us in the Maghreb... Operation Vanguard he called it.  It was a killing field.  One by one Turner executed our brothers and sisters as they valiantly tried to place an explosive device.  It was in that moment a question took root in his mind.  What cause could motivate these people to throw their lives away with such determination.  He sought me out... and I provided answers."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_bank_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: I don't know how, but Felix learned about our bank heist and his jack-booted thugs are en route.  It falls on you two to steel your resolve and cut the oppressors down."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_fruitless_turner_sub"				"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: We have shown the world that the struggle is not fruitless... now anarchists have spread throughout Europe... eager to break the government's gilded cage."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_fear_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Fear is a construct of the mind, and it's something our enemies wield with alarming grace.  You see; when people are scared, they turn to those with authority for solutions, because they're conditioned to feel powerless. That's why engaging with nuclear options is critical: Once we show that the ivory tower can do nothing to save them...they will rise to help themselves."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_elysee_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: Titans of industry all flocked to the Elysee resort - a temple of excess designed to coddle CEOs who made their fortunes on the backs of laborers.  They'd laugh as they clinked glasses full champagne... each flute filled with one month's salary of their employees.  But soon they would stop laughing."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_history_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: History may be written by the victors, but that doesn't mean we have to buy the book.  We lost the battle in Maghreb, but we gained the loyalty of Turner.  Now, Turner is dead, but we have gained you.  The Coalition believes that they've struck a blow against us, but like the story of Turner's defection, like the story of our namesake... defeat is never the end.  The Phoenix can never die."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_cobble_turner_sub"					"<b>Valeria Jenner</b>: The capture of Lord William is one of The Phoenix's greatest triumphs.  Turner lead a small unit to William's estate,  dragging that sniveling worm out from his ivory tower.  The Coalition Taskforce tried in vain to save him... but Turner laid them low with the SSG08."
	"Op_bloodhound_Valeria_journalist_turner_sub"				"<b>Chase Turner</b>: That journalist we captured during operation Vanguard seems to have more friends we thought.  Our safehouse has been compromised, and Felix's thugs are coming in force.  Support isn't coming.  It's up to you two to hold the line."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_intro"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Nice to meet you, I'm Chase Turner.   I wish I had time to give a fancy speech but we got a problem.  Sebastien Hennequet has sent an Operator named Jackson to assassinate Valeria. Nothing is more important than her survival."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_headshot"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Our battles are fought in the streets.  In businesses.  In people's homes.  And for that reason it's critical that when we send a bullet downfield it hits its intended target.  We're not butchers.  We're surgeons."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_prodigy"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Before I became a freedom fighter I was a sniper... trained by the best.  Sebastien called me a prodigy, but I'm not so sure that being able to reliably kill a man who doesn't even know you're there is something to be proud of... regardless, the skills I learned have kept me alive.   When securing Underhill and Murphy, be sure to maintain sightlines on the room with the metal detector... you're asking to be flanked if you don't."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_hero"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: I hate this part of the world... too many bad memories.  Back when I was in the Taskforce they heralded me as a hero because I was able to hold bombsite A single handedly. Hero...  I just posted up by some barrels with good visibility and killed anyone with the courage to think for themselves.  I was no hero... I was a monster."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_cobble"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Lord William was one of the major backers of the Coalition Taskforce, but his money was as dirty as it came.  Abducting William was easy.  Waiting for evac... now that was the hard part."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_chaos"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: We're trained at a young age that chaos is wrong.  That we need order for society to survive... but the reality is that order doesn't serve the common man... order serves those in power.  The ones that get to tell people's children to fight their battles... who impose their laws and faith unto others for a nebulous greater good with impossible standards.  It's a con job.  We shouldn't fear people thinking for themselves."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_valeria"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: When Valeria first asked me to steal nuclear materials, I balked: if I was wrong about her... if my trust was misplaced.... I would be giving a mad woman the ability to kill millions.  But my faith was rewarded.  Valeria doesn't want to destroy world.  She wants to save it."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_underhill"					"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Underhill and Murphy is gathering their clients for an all-paid bacchanal at the Elysee Resort.  Those men and women care about profit margins, not people... but soon they won't be rewarded for their avarice."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_shame"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: I'm ashamed of the things that I've done in the name of my country... but I can't wallow in that misery.  All I can do now is try to change the world for the better.  And yes, our new world will be built atop the bodies of the fallen but change isn't easy.  We aren't fighting soldiers... we aren't fighting peace keepers... we're fighting learned helplessness.  And when this sleeping world awakes... it will thank us."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_blunt"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Well, we must be doing something right... The Taskforce is sending a top notch sniper to kill us.  Chapel trained with me under Sebastien Hennequet; he's one the best... but it won't be good enough.  Find him and put him down before he does the same to you."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_booth"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Someone sold us out, and now a simple bank job's about to turn into a standoff.  Hang tight.  I'm bringing a cell to pull you and your partner out.  I'm not leaving one of our own behind."
	"Op_Bloodhound_Turner_journalist"					"<b>Chase Turner</b>: When I defected during Operation Vanguard, I took something with me... a journalist named Alex Kincaide.  We thought Kincaide was secure at one of our safehouses but the Coalition Taskforce has compromised the location.  Valeria needs that journalist.  Take a friend for backup and make sure no one touches Kincaide."
	"op_bloodhound_turner_AWP"						"<b>Chase Turner</b>: Hennequet was wrong about a lot of things, but had one thing right: one bullet can change the world.  I want you to get comfortable with the AWP.  Yes it's expensive, but sniper rifles don't come more blue chip.  Let's stick with the basics here... Rome wasn't built in a day."	
	"op_bloodhound_booth_Spend_sub"						"<b>Booth</b>: I've been waiting for you... Valeria said she was sending someone new to pick up her latest shipment of goodies.  I'm dying to see what you're going to buy for her."
	"op_bloodhound_booth_flash_sub"						"<b>Booth</b>: Flashbangs are wonderful little things:   They can buy you time for an escape or they can create an opportunity for a kill... and fortunately for you, I happen to have a surplus I'm dying to unload."
	"op_bloodhound_booth_bomb_sub"						"<b>Booth</b>: A farmer would never plant a seed and walk away.  No... he nurtures his crops,  protecting them from being nicked by nasty little creatures.  So it is with plastic explosives.  Show me that you can be a reliable demolitionist, and you'll be rewarded."

	"op07_subtitle_701"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Operation Bloodhound was a success.  Turner is dead, and the Phoenix are still recovering from their loss.  Now is the time to put on the pressure… to hit multiple Phoenix operations at once… to spread like wildfire.  My name is Major Felix Riley, and together we're going to stop Valeria."
	"op07_subtitle_702"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Ladies and Gentlemen, the Phoenix have occupied a cruise ship and it falls on us to stop them.  Remember, just because you're engaging enemies on the lido deck doesn't mean there's time for short-poured mai tais.  Good luck."
	"op07_subtitle_703"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  The Phoenix have dug into the ship and are holding hostages.  I want every passenger, every crew member, every second rate entertainer accounted for.  I won't stand for another Vanguard incident."

	"op07_subtitle_718"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  With the exception of us controlling the weapons you'll be using, this is about as close to the real thing as you're going to get."
	"op07_subtitle_719"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  This is the heart of what we do.  The Phoenix will stop at nothing to plant their explosives… we have to be as committed to defusing them."
	"op07_subtitle_720"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  A disoriented enemy is an enemy that is not murdering you or your teammates.  Get proficient with flashbangs, and use them to gain position on your opponents."
	"op07_subtitle_721"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Some people, like Sebastien, like to keep their distance… some people, like Kotaro, like to be up close and personal… this exercise is more up Kotaro's alley."

	"op07_subtitle_723"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  You're a part of a team… if you need something and don't have enough money, don't be afraid to ask your allies to provide you with a weapon."
	"op07_subtitle_724"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  If you want to fight the Phoenix, you need to learn how to think like them.  Their strategies are always evolving, and ours should follow suit."
	"op07_subtitle_725"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Molotov's are a great way to lock down an area and control enemy movement, so get used to carrying petrol in a beer bottle."
	"op07_subtitle_726"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  If you want to survive, it's important that you look to your team for support when you need it.  Use an ally's weapon to stop The Phoenix."
	"op07_subtitle_727"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  The pistol can be a challenging weapon, but if you can master it you will be able to get an early advantage on your opponents."
	"op07_subtitle_728"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Time to put together everything you've learned: good luck, and make us all proud."

We work in pairs, relying on teamwork to take out overwhelming force.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Let's see what you got."
	"op07_subtitle_802"							"<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Felix likes to trumpet the success of Operation Bloodhound, but he still has egg on his face after Alex Kincaide got captured during Vanguard.  Once we get you two up to speed we're going to clean up his mess."
	"op07_subtitle_803"							"<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  When we go after Kincaide you'll have very little support in the field… get comfortable with using the weapons of our enemies against them."
	"op07_subtitle_804"							"<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  Alex Kincaide has been a Phoenix captive since Operation Vanguard…. that ends today.  It took months, but I was able to get intel on Kincaide's location: a cement factory owned by industrialist and Phoenix sympathizer Franz Kriegeld.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Get in the factory, and extract Kincaide - once he's safe we'll find a way to nail Kriegeld."	
	"op07_subtitle_805"							"<b>Alex Kincaide:</b>  Franz and Valeria would argue all the time; but one thing they both agreed on was that the Empire Taxi Company had to go - I don't know what a bunch of New York cabbies did to piss off The Phoenix, but they're going to hit there next."
	"op07_subtitle_806"							"<b>Alex Kincaide:</b>  In one of our interviews, Valeria told me The Phoenix weren't finished destroying Lord William's legacy - they're looking to attack all of his estates."
	"op07_subtitle_807"							"<b>Alex Kincaide:</b>  Kriegeld is wielding The Phoenix like a sword, using them to target industries that he's competing with."
	"op07_subtitle_808"							"<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  Great job extracting Kincaide, Carmen couldn't have done it better.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Now that he's safe: let's focus on Kriegeld.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  We'll get to that… I had something else in mind."			
	"op07_subtitle_809"							"<b>Booth:</b>  Now I may be mistaken, but you strike me as an enterprising individual with an eye for opportunity... The name's Booth, and I think we can help each other out.  You need guns for your war, and I need money for single malt scotch.  If you showcase some of my weapons on the battlefield I'll make sure something nice falls off the truck for you."
	"op07_subtitle_810"							"<b>Booth:</b>  Conflict has been around ever since the first caveman learned how to pick up a rock... it's human nature that drives us to war.  And seeing as you can't fight human nature it seems like I might as well make a little money out of it, right?  <i>Right</i>."
	"op07_subtitle_811"							"<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  My source just informed me of another Operation being spearheaded by some of Valeria's hired thugs.  Let's move."
	"op07_subtitle_812"							"<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Kotaro, Felix wants to talk to us…\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  It can wait.  There's still work to do."
	"op07_subtitle_813"							"<b>Booth:</b>  Some bleeding hearts question the ethics of arming two sides of the same conflict but people like you and me understand the way the world works.  There are no <i>good guys</i> and <i>bad guys</i>, everyone is a hero in their own story.  Don't get me wrong, I don't subscribe to that whole load of bollocks that Valeria Jenner is peddling; but at the end of the day it's a bit like having a great aunt that pinches your cheeks every time you see her.  Does she annoy the piss out of you?  Yes.  Do you turn down her birthday present?  Fuck no."
	"op07_subtitle_814"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Kotaro, I need your people stateside: we have an opportunity to catch Kriegeld red handed.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  But sir, we're just starting to see results here in Europe, I need more ti-\n\n<b>Felix Riley:</b> After you finish this op you're going back to the States…that's an order Kotaro.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b> Yes sir."
	"op07_subtitle_815"							"<b>Booth:</b>  If you're feeling any pangs of guilt about working with me I wouldn't worry too much about it.  People in our lines of work don't tend to live long, so I say just enjoy the ride as long as you can."
	"op07_subtitle_816"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  We just got the full debrief from Kincaide.  Franz Kriegeld is using his business as a front to help finance the Phoenix... but if we're going to start freezing his assets we're going to need proof.  I don't like sending you back into the lion's den, but this is our chance to deal some lasting damage to The Phoenix."	
	"op07_subtitle_817"							"<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Kotaro, what are you doing?\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  Following the money.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  We're not authorized to-\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  You of all people don't get to lecture me on procedure.  Valeria has been using Elliot Kingsman's goons to bolster her numbers and now we have proof.  I'm going after Kingsman… are you with me or not?\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  *sigh* I'm with you."			
	"op07_subtitle_818"							"<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  I still think this is a terrible idea.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  It's for posterity.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  It's for our court martial. \n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  Just say your damn name.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  *sigh* I'm Carmen Cocinero\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  and I'm Kotaro Izaki.  In the event that we fail, this recording is proof that we are operating as individuals, not as sanctioned members of the Coalition Taskforce.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  But we wouldn't mind a pardon…\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  Carmen...\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  <i>I</i> wouldn't mind a pardon."
	"op07_subtitle_819"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  Carmen and Kotaro may be AWOL, but our focus can't change: we need to stop The Phoenix."
	"op07_subtitle_820"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  The financials you stole from Kriegeld aren't just going to help us freeze his assets… they're a road map for future Phoenix Operations."
	"op07_subtitle_821"							"<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  We're getting close to Kingsman: I can feel it.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  Kotaro:  they're baiting us… Kingsman didn't show at the last two jobs… it's a trap.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  Of course it's a trap - but someone has to be there to spring it.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  This is insane.\n\n<b>Kotaro Izaki:</b>  You're free to go whenever you want Carmen.\n\n<b>Carmen Cocinero:</b>  No… we're in this together."	
	"op07_subtitle_822"							"<b>Felix Riley:</b>  We just received word that Valeria is en route to the cement factory:  Finish up your business in the Maghreb and return to the states: this could be our best chance to take her out."
	"op07_subtitle_823"							"<b>Booth:</b>  Hello again, it's your old friend Booth.  Now obviously as a businessman I make it a point not to choose sides, and as such I would never reveal critical information to either the Coalition Taskforce or The Phoenix.  My daughter however, does not seem to share my love of discretion and is now marked for death by Valeria.  Again, it would be inappropriate of me to interfere or ask for any favors; however, I imagine if you helped extract Imogen from the Phoenix base she is now hiding in, she would be quite grateful for your assistance."
	"op07_subtitle_824"							"<b>Imogen:</b>  Thank you for saving me… I owe you, and I always repay my debts.  Now, a little birdie told me Valeria survived our fireworks show, but her blood is in the water and sharks are circling.  Different cells are stepping up activity to prove that they are strong enough to lead The Phoenix.  You push back these splinter groups, and The Phoenix will remain leaderless until Valeria recovers."
	"op07_subtitle_825"							"<b>Imogen:</b>  Franz Kriegeld was Valeria's heir apparent - it's his money that helped finance the operation and he felt he should be in charge… however now that his assets are being frozen he's looking to prove he has other skills that are useful to The Phoenix."
	"op07_subtitle_826"							"<b>Imogen:</b>  While Valeria recovers, it falls on Naomi to maintain the status quo and show that the powerbase of The Phoenix has not eroded.  She's a zealot who truly believes in her cause."
	"op07_subtitle_827"							"<b>Imogen:</b>  Since Turner's death, Valeria had sought to find his replacement… she found him in Mikha Biton: a mossad operative who has crossed over to The Phoenix.  He's still a relative unknown, but there's few things more dangerous than someone looking to prove themselves."
